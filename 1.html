Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I'll be fine
'Cuz I know Peter Pan was right
Just a lost boy in a small town
I'm the same kid but I'm grown now
Try to make it out
But I don't know how
Wish that I was young
What have I become
Now it's late night and I'm at home
So I make friends with shadow
And I play him all my sad sad songs
And we don't talk
But he sings along like
Oooh
Fairy tales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do
Mmmmmm..
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I'll be fine
'Cuz I know Peter Pan was right
Days feel like a blur now
Still feel eighteen but I'm burnt out
So I daydream of what I could be
If I turned back time
To a storyline
Where my mom read me a tale where
A couple kids one girl and a sailor
Met a boy in green
I thought it'd be me
But I guess that dream
Wasn't meant to be like
Oooh
Fairy tales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do
Mmmmmm..
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I'll be fine
'Cuz I know Peter Pan was right
And I don't care
If I never land
Cuz' the distant sky's
Always better than
My life right now
And the place I am
So for one last time
I guess Peter Pan..
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I'll be fine
'Cuz I know Peter Pan was right...</body></html>
